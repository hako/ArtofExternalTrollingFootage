CHANGELOG:
--------------------------------------------
2.0: 
--------------------------------------------

+ Now open source.

+ Fixed menu (X) bug.

+ Tweaked the footage with a more retro vibe. ;)

+ Rewritten the whole game. (Took me 2 weeks approx due to the video plugin sound output failure which I thank IceDaddy for helping me.)

+ Fixed some very minor bugs.

NOTE:

In this version, I have rewritten everything plus the whole footage 
due to lost sourcecode, so I had to start again.

'The Art of External Trolling - The Irony' ;)

You may find the whole game slightly different from the first one.

I also updated game due to video plugin update from IceDaddy.

Thanks to him the video plugin no longer handicapped!
